# Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been into programming for a couple of years now and decided to create an account here.  
During this time, I explored different languages and built a few projects.  

On a more serious level, it all started with the web â€” the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JS**.  
I quickly lost interest and moved on: tried **Java**, but it didnâ€™t click, so I switched to **C**.  
Later, I focused on **C++**, often working with **Raylib**.  

My favorite project is a **raycast engine in C++**,  
which Iâ€™m now using as the foundation for an **online shooter** Iâ€™m developing in my free time.
