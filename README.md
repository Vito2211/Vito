# 👋 Hi, I’m Vito
Welcome to my personal repository!

## 💡 About Me
- 🌱 Programming for a couple of years  
- 🖥️ Started with **HTML, CSS, JS**  
- ⚙️ Moved into **C and C++** (with Raylib)  
- 🎮 Favorite project: a **raycast engine**, now evolving into an **online shooter**  
- 🍏 Currently exploring **Swift development**  



I’ve been into programming for a couple of years now and decided to create an account here.  
During this time, I explored different languages and built a few projects.  

On a more serious level, it all started with the web — the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JS**.  
I quickly lost interest and moved on: tried **Java**, but it didn’t click, so I switched to **C**.  
Later, I focused on **C++**, often working with **Raylib**.  

My favorite project is a **raycast engine in C++**,  
which I’m now using as the foundation for an **online shooter** I’m developing in my free time.

Most recently, I’ve been moving towards **Swift development**,  
exploring mobile and Apple ecosystem programming.
